# Crowd Tracker

### Description

The Crowd Tracker application allows a user to find the degrees of separtion between two individuals.

The application is built using Vanilla JavaScript to create basic classes for Nodes and Graphs.

I would like to add JavaScript modules to separte the the user data from the breadth first search responsibilites.
